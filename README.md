### Title: Commonalities in gene expression and methylation changes across two rat models of acquired epilepsy

### Abstract
Changes in DNA methylation and gene expression play a major role in the epileptogenic process that turns a healthy brain into an epileptic brain. The goal of this investigation was to identify shared and distinct changes in gene expression and methylation in two widely used but mechanistically distinct rat models of temporal lobe epilepsy: intrahippocampal electrical kindling and systemic kainic acid. RNA sequencing and reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing were used to assess differences in gene expression and DNA methylation. Considering the distinct histopathological features of the electrical kindling and kainic acid models, we anticipated that gene expression and DNA methylation changes during epileptogenesis would be largely non-overlapping, but that areas of overlap would highlight generalizable, model-independent epileptogenesis pathways. Five genes (Fcgbp1, Loxhd1, Nedd9, Ptpre, and Adcy4) were differentially methylated and expressed in both models. Identifying these genes in different epilepsy models suggests a common methylation-regulated dysregulation in epileptogenesis, highlighting potential targets for future therapeutic interventions.
